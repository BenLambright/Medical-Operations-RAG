    "question":  "Given the following information, describe the operation (including materials) in detail. A man in his mid-sixties was diagnosed with a lateral renal tumor in the lower pole of the left kidney. Imaging and biopsy confirmed renal cell carcinoma. Given its position and size, what surgical approach would be appropriate?",
    "answer": "Epidural anesthesia was administered in the holding area, after which the patient was transferred into the operating room.  General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, after which the patient was positioned in the flank standard position.  A left flank incision was made over the area of the twelfth rib.  The subcutaneous space was opened by using the Bovie.  The ribs were palpated clearly and the fascia overlying the intercostal space between the eleventh and twelfth rib was opened by using the Bovie.  The fascial layer covering of the intercostal space was opened completely until the retroperitoneum was entered.  Once the retroperitoneum had been entered, the incision was extended until the peritoneal envelope could be identified.  The peritoneum was swept medially.  The Finochietto retractor was then placed for exposure.  The kidney was readily identified and was mobilized from outside Gerota's fascia.  The ureter was dissected out easily and was separated with a vessel loop.  The superior aspect of the kidney was mobilized from the superior attachment.  The pedicle of the left kidney was completely dissected revealing the vein and the artery.  The artery was a single artery and was dissected easily by using a right-angle clamp.  A vessel loop was placed around the renal artery.  The tumor could be easily palpated in the lateral lower pole to mid pole of the left kidney.  The Gerota's fascia overlying that portion of the kidney was opened in the area circumferential to the tumor.  Once the renal capsule had been identified, the capsule was scored using a Bovie about 0.5 cm lateral to the border of the tumor.  Bulldog clamp was then placed on the renal artery.  The tumor was then bluntly dissected off of the kidney with a thin rim of a normal renal cortex.  This was performed by using the blunted end of the scalpel.  The tumor was removed easily.  The argon beam coagulation device was then utilized to coagulate the base of the resection.  The visible larger bleeding vessels were oversewn by using 4-0 Vicryl suture.  The edges of the kidney were then reapproximated by using 2-0 Vicryl suture with pledgets at the ends of the sutures to prevent the sutures from pulling through.  Two horizontal mattress sutures were placed and were tied down.  The Gerota's fascia was then also closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The area of the kidney at the base was covered with Surgicel prior to tying the sutures.  The bulldog clamp was removed and perfect hemostasis was evident.  There was no evidence of violation into the calyceal system.  A 19-French Blake drain was placed in the inferior aspect of the kidney exiting the left flank inferior to the incision.  The drain was anchored by using silk sutures.  The flank fascial layers were closed in three separate layers in the more medial aspect.  The lateral posterior aspect was closed in two separate layers using Vicryl sutures."

    "question":  "Given the following information, describe the operation (including materials) in detail. A 19-year-old first-time mother (G1, P1) who experienced persistent vaginal bleeding and large clot passage approximately four hours after a vaginal delivery. Diagnosed with Postpartum hemorrhage.",
    "answer": "The patient was taken to the operating room where satisfactory conscious sedation was performed.  She was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Bimanual exam revealed moderate amount of clot in the uterus.  I was able to remove most of the clots with my hands and an attempt at short curettage was performed, but because of contraction of the uterus this was unable to be adequately performed.  I was able to thoroughly examine the uterine cavity with my hand and no remaining clots or placental tissue or membranes were found.  At this point, the procedure was terminated.  Bleeding at this time was minimal.  Preop H&H were 8.3 and 24.2.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition."

    "question":  "Given the following information, describe the operation (including materials) in detail. A patient presenting with a swollen, infected area on the left side of the neck consistent with a submandibular abscess.",
    "answer": "The patient was taken to operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General inhalational anesthesia was administered.  The patient was draped in usual fashion.  The prominent area of the left submandibular swelling was noted and a 1-cm incision was outlined with a marking pen and the area was infiltrated with 0.5 mL of local anesthetic using 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000.  The incision was performed with a #15 blade.  An 18-gauge needle and 10 mL syringe was used to evacuate a small amount of the purulence from the abscess cavity.  This was submitted for culture and sensitivity, anaerobic cultures and Gram stain.  The cavity was opened with a small hemostat and a great deal of grossly purulent material was evacuated.  The cavity was irrigated with peroxide and saline.  A 0.25-inch Penrose drain was placed and secured with a single #3-0 nylon suture.  A 4 x 4 dressing was applied.  Bleeding was negligible.  There were no untoward complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."

    "question":  "Given the following information, describe the operation (including materials) in detail. An 85-year-old female with blood loss anemia and previously incomplete colonoscopy due to poor bowel preparation underwent colonoscopy for further evaluation.",
    "answer": "After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Endoscopy Suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given sedation by the Anesthesia Department.  A digital rectal exam was performed and there was no evidence of mass.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the rectum.  There was some solid stool encountered.  The scope was maneuvered around this.  There was relatively poor prep as the scope was advanced through the sigmoid colon and portions of the descending colon.  The scope was then passed through the transverse colon and ascending colon to the cecum.  No masses or polyps were noted.  Visualization of the portions of the colon was however somewhat limited.  There were scattered diverticuli noted in the sigmoid.,The scope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed and nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids were noted.  The scope was then completely withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  She will be placed on a high-fiber diet and Colace and we will continue to monitor her hemoglobin."

    "question":  "Given the following information, describe the operation (including materials) in detail. A 30-year-old white female presented with chronic left shoulder pain unresponsive to conservative outpatient treatment. She was diagnosed with 1.  Impingement syndrome, left shoulder.,2.  Rule out superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion, left shoulder.",
    "answer": "The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, she was placed in modified beachchair position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created outside the end, anterior and posterior, posterior and anterior, and subsequently laterally.  A full and complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the intraarticular aspect of the joint with the above noted findings.,Attention was then turned to the subacromial region.  The scope was placed.  A lateral portal was created.  Gross bursectomy was carried out.  This was done with a 4.2 meniscal shaver as well as a hot Bovie.  Calcium deposition mentioned was removed.  With the rotator cuff intact, the periosteum was burned off the undersurface of the acromion and the CA ligament released anteriorly.  A subacromial decompression sequentially from laterally to medially was then carried out.  There was an excellent decompression.  Debridement was carried out to the bursa.  The portals were ultimately closed with #4-0 after Pain Buster catheter had been placed.  Subacromial region was flooded with 0.5% Marcaine at approximately 15 cc or so.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing.  The patient was awoken and transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair."

A 52-year-old morbidly obese Black woman with a longstanding history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and associated symptoms, including chronic dyspepsia, hoarseness, and persistent cough. Despite trying multiple medical treatments, her symptoms have remained refractory to therapy.",
    "answer": "After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation achieved, the gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and the esophagus was easily intubated.  At the GE junction, a hiatal hernia was present.  There were mild inflammatory changes consistent with reflux esophagitis.  The scope was then passed into the stomach.  It was insufflated and the scope was coursed along the greater curvature to the antrum.  The pylorus was patent.  There was evidence of bile reflux in the antrum.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined and were without evidence of mass, ulceration, or inflammation.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum.,A retroflexion was attempted multiple times, however, the patient was having difficulty holding the air and adequate retroflexion view was not visualized.  The gastroscope was then slowly withdrawn.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the fundus or body.  Once again at the GE junction, esophageal biopsy was taken.  The scope was then completely withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will return to the General Medical Floor.  We will continue b.i.d proton-pump inhibitor therapy as well as dietary restrictions.  She should also attempt significant weight loss."
